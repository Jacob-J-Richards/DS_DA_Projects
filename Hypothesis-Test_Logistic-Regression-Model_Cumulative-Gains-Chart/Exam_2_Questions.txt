Problem Statement:
You work as a Data Scientist at a Payments processor company.
On, Feb 14, 2020, you get calls from many merchants. Merchants tell you that they are seeing a spike in customer 
complaints and want you to check if there are any issues. You tell them that you are going to revert to them in a few hours.

Goal:
To identify what exactly happened to these merchants and which other merchants got impacted and understand the magnitude of the impact.

Data
You have the payment transactions data for Feb 12, 13 and 14 in a file.

Below is a description of different columns in the data set
hr : Start hour of the transaction
mid : Merchant Identifier
t : Total number of transactions
success : Total number of successful transactions
pg : Payment Gateway, who collects money on behalf of the merchant
pmt : Payment Method Type such as cards, UPI etc.,
sub_type : The subtype of payment option chosen by the customer
bank : The customer bank account from which the money is sent

Questions:

1.1.1 Which dimension combination caused the issue?
Explore the data and visualization to understand when the issue (possibly a significant number of failures in transactions ) 
happened and which combination of dimension (pmt, pg, bank and sub_type) has the impact.
Tip: Identify the method to detect an anomaly in a metric across 4+ dimensions and apply that method to find the above.

1.1.2 When did the issue happen?
What is the starting hour and ending hour of the reported issue?
Illustrate your answer with a plot

1.1.3 For whom did the issue happen?
Which all merchants were impacted because of the issue and which all merchants were not? Illustrate your answer with a plot and a table.
