**undergraduate extra credit** (5) (Use R) This problem is required for
Grad students (those of you registered in STAT 505) but can be extra
credit for undergrad students. A researcher needs your expertise to
combine the so called SRH (Health rate) before and after a treatment. A
random sample of size n = 2000 individuals were selected. A random
sample of 1000 individuals were then subjected to the treatment and
another 1000 to the control group. In the first data file called “SRH”,
their status pre and post experiment are reported in. The weights of the
treatment and control group were then record in the files called
“weight_treatment” and “weight_control.” Combine the 3 data files
properly to create an analytic dataset as shown in the sample below:
Remember to sort the id in increasing order and sort the time in PRE and
POST order. Provide code for how you arrived at your analytic data set.

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/Stat_405_R/Stat 405 M10 HW")
SRH <- as.data.frame(read.csv(file = "SRH(1).csv", header = TRUE))
weight_control <- as.data.frame(read.csv(file = "weight_control(1).csv", header = TRUE))
weight_treatment <- as.data.frame(read.csv(file = "weight_treatment(1).csv", header = TRUE))
```

```{r}
(head(SRH,5))
(head(weight_control,5))
(head(weight_treatment,5))

SRH_id_sorted <- SRH[order(SRH[,1], SRH[,3] == "POST"), ]
WC_id_sorted <- weight_control[order(weight_control[,1]),]
WT_id_sorted <- weight_treatment[order(weight_treatment[,1]),]

Pre_WT <- na.omit(WT_id_sorted[,1:2]) 
Post_WT <- na.omit(WT_id_sorted[,c(1,3)])
Pre_WC <- na.omit(WC_id_sorted[,1:2])
Post_WC <- na.omit(WC_id_sorted[,c(1,3)])

Append <- numeric(nrow(SRH_id_sorted))

Final <- cbind(SRH_id_sorted,Append)

Final[Final[,3] == "PRE",5] <- Pre_WT[,2]
Final[Final[,3] == "POST",5] <- Post_WT[,2]

Pre_WC_id_nums <- Pre_WC[,1]
Post_WC_id_nums <- Post_WC[,1]

Final[which(Final[,1] %in% Pre_WC_id_nums & Final[,3] %in% "PRE"),5] <- Pre_WC[,2]
Final[which(Final[,1] %in% Post_WC_id_nums & Final[,3] %in% "POST"),5] <- Post_WC[,2]

trt <- Final[,2]
time <- Final[,3]
Final[,2] <- time
Final[,3] <- trt

colnames(Final) <- c("id","time","trt","SRH","weight")
print(head(Final,10))
write.csv(Final, "analytic_data_set.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
